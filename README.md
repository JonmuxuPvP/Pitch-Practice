# Pitch-Practice

Welcome to my little fun music project. I'm developing a web application to help you train your relative pitch skills.

## How does it work?
It's very simple, four buttons will be enough to help you train your ear, these being:

- Random note
- Replay note
- Root note
- Hide note

Play around with them as much as you want and try to guess all of the notes correctly. If you grow tired of the same key, changing it is just one click away.

## Notice

This project is a prototype used to test out the possibilities I have with JavaScript in order to create this app. This app is discontinued and will never be updated. If you wish to use it though, refer to one of my other repositories in my GitHub to find out about the new and improved Pitch Practice Application :3
