# Pitch-Practice

Welcome to my little fun music project. I'm developing a web application to help you train your relative pitch skills.

## How does it work?
It's very simple, four buttons will be enough to help you train your ear, these being:

- Random note
- Replay note
- Root note
- Hide note

Play around with them as much as you want and try to guess all of the notes correctly. If you grow tired of the same key, changing it is just one click away.

## Disclaimer

There is no guarantee I will keep this project alive, but it will get updated from time to time. I want to try and add as many features as I can to provide a better user experience for everyone.
